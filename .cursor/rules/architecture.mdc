# Architecture

This is a Rails 8 application with a focus on clean architecture and maintainable code.

## Backend Architecture
- Standard Rails 8 backend with minimal JS provided by Stimulus
- Frontend mapping functionality provided by leaflet.js
- Background worker using Sidekiq and Sidekiq scheduler for nightly data downloads

## Code Organization
- External service connections are stored in `lib/connections/`
- Business logic is moved out of controllers/jobs into service objects and connection classes
- Models handle data persistence and validation
- Jobs coordinate background tasks
