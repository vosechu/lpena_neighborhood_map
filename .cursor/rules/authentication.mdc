# Authentication and authorization

## Authentication

- There are no guest users of this app.
  + Aside from the login page and the opt-out page, all endpoints require authentication
- This is an invite-only app. There is no way for someone to create an account without being added by a neighbor.
- The target users of this app are not technically savvy, so we prefer the simplest and most common mechanisms, even if they aren't the hottest new technology.

## Authorization

- Check abilities, not roles. Never check for "isAdmin?"
- There is no "admin", but there are many people that need advanced roles, like the board of the neighborhood association or the welcoming committee
- APIs must be checked for permissions
- For the JS frontend, permissions are held on `data-controller="map"` in [map.html.erb](mdc:app/views/pages/map.html.erb)

## General permissions

- In general, users can manage almost anything about houses and residents. This is like a wiki.
- Details about the User object are restricted to the user and folks with elevated capabilities.
- Details about field visibility are restricted to the user and folks with elevated capabilities.
- Opting out of emails or hiding all fields are available via a special devise token, but don't require any permissions checks at all.
- The Avo admin panel is restricted to folks with elevated capabilities, but still requires permissions just like elsewhere on the site.
