# Background Jobs Guide

## Job Structure
The application uses Sidekiq for background job processing. All jobs should:
- Be placed in [app/jobs/](mdc:app/jobs)
- Inherit from `ApplicationJob`
- Include clear documentation of their purpose
- Have corresponding tests in [spec/jobs/](mdc:spec/jobs)

## Key Files
- [app/jobs/download_property_data_job.rb](mdc:app/jobs/download_property_data_job.rb) - Downloads property data from PCPA GIS
- [config/sidekiq.yml](mdc:config/sidekiq.yml) - Sidekiq configuration
- [config/sidekiq_schedule.yml](mdc:config/sidekiq_schedule.yml) - Job schedule configuration

## Best Practices
1. Jobs should be idempotent
2. Use retries appropriately for network operations
3. Log meaningful progress for long-running jobs
4. Use scheduled jobs for recurring tasks
5. Keep jobs focused and single-purpose
