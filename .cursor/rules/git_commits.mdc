# Git Commit Message Standards

Follow these standards for consistent, professional git commit messages.

## Format Structure
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Subject Line Rules
- **Length**: Maximum 50 characters
- **Case**: Start with capital letter
- **Mood**: Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature" or "Adds feature")
- **Punctuation**: No trailing period
- **Present tense**: Write as if completing "This commit will..."

## Types (Required)
- `feat`: New feature for the user
- `fix`: Bug fix for the user
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring (no functional changes)
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Build process, dependency updates, tooling

## Scope (Optional)
- Specify the area of change: `feat(auth): add password reset`
- Use lowercase, no spaces: `fix(api): handle null responses`

## Body Rules
- **Length**: Wrap at 72 characters per line
- **Purpose**: Explain the "what" and "why", not the "how"
- **Separate**: Blank line between subject and body
- **Multiple lines**: OK for complex changes

## Footer Rules
- **Breaking changes**: `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>`
- **Issue references**: `Fixes #123` or `Closes #456`
- **Co-authors**: `Co-authored-by: Name <email>`

## Examples

### Simple feature
```
feat: add email unsubscribe functionality
```

### Bug fix with scope
```
fix(auth): prevent duplicate user creation
```

### Feature with body
```
feat: add one-click email unsubscribe

Add Gmail-style unsubscribe functionality with List-Unsubscribe
headers. Users can unsubscribe without visiting the website.

- Add EmailSafetyInterceptor for non-production environments
- Include unsubscribe links in all notification emails
- Support both form-based and one-click unsubscribe flows
```

### Breaking change
```
feat!: redesign user authentication system

BREAKING CHANGE: The authentication API has changed. All clients
must update to use the new JWT token format.

Fixes #234
```

## What NOT to do
- ❌ `fix stuff` (too vague)
- ❌ `Fixed the bug where users couldn't login` (past tense)
- ❌ `Add email unsubscribe functionality.` (trailing period)
- ❌ `EMAIL UNSUBSCRIBE FEATURE` (all caps)
- ❌ `feat: this commit adds a really long subject line that exceeds fifty characters` (too long)

## Multi-commit features
For large features spanning multiple commits:
```
feat: add email opt-out system foundation
feat: add one-click unsubscribe routes
feat: add email safety interceptor
docs: add email opt-out documentation
```

## Commit frequency
- Commit early and often with logical units of work
- Each commit should be a complete, working change
- Avoid "WIP" or "temp" commits in main branch
- Use interactive rebase to clean up commit history before merging
