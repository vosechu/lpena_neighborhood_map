# External Services Guide

## Service Connections
All external service connections should:
- Be placed in [lib/connections/](mdc:lib/connections)
- Have corresponding tests in [spec/connections/](mdc:spec/connections)
- Include proper error handling
- Use environment variables for configuration

## Key Services
- PCPA GIS Service: [lib/connections/pcpa_gis_connection.rb](mdc:lib/connections/pcpa_gis_connection.rb)
  - Provides property data
  - Used by background jobs for nightly updates

## Best Practices
1. Use connection classes to encapsulate external service logic
2. Include retry logic for network operations
3. Log all significant operations
4. Use WebMock in tests to prevent real network calls
5. Document API endpoints and expected responses
6. Handle rate limiting appropriately
