# Code Style Guide

## Ruby Style
The project follows standard Ruby style conventions as defined in [.rubocop.yml](mdc:.rubocop.yml):
- Use single quotes for strings unless interpolation is needed
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Keep lines under 120 characters
- Use snake_case for methods and variables
- Use CamelCase for classes and modules

## Testing Style
- Tests follow RSpec best practices
- One expectation per test when possible
- Use descriptive context and it blocks
- Follow the patterns in [testing.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/testing.mdc)

## Automation
- Guard automatically runs:
  - RSpec tests on file changes
  - RuboCop style checks
  - Other configured tasks
- See [Guardfile](mdc:Guardfile) for automation configuration

## Process
1. Write tests first (TDD)
2. Run Guard while developing
3. Fix all RuboCop warnings before committing
4. Keep commits focused and well-documented
