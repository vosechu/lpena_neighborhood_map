# Code Style Guide

## Ruby Style
The project follows standard Ruby style conventions as defined in [.rubocop.yml](mdc:.rubocop.yml):
- Use single quotes for strings unless interpolation is needed
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Keep lines under 120 characters
- Use snake_case for methods and variables
- Use CamelCase for classes and modules

## Process
1. Write failing tests first (TDD)
2. Fix the code
3. Run the specs and fix any failures
3. Fix all RuboCop warnings
4. Keep commits focused and well-documented
