# Enhanced Background Job Implementation

## Overview

This implementation enhances the existing `DownloadPropertyDataJob` with comprehensive data conflict management and admin notification capabilities as requested in the .taskpaper file.

## Components Implemented

### 1. DataConflictManager Service (`app/services/data_conflict_manager.rb`)

A comprehensive service that detects and manages data conflicts during property imports:

**Conflict Types Detected:**
- **Address Changes**: Street number, street name, city, or zip code changes
- **Coordinate Changes**: GPS coordinate changes beyond 10-meter threshold
- **Ownership Changes**: Property owner name changes

**Features:**
- Automatic conflict resolution using "latest data wins" strategy
- Detailed conflict logging with old/new value tracking
- Summary statistics and conflict categorization
- Distance calculation for coordinate changes using Haversine formula

### 2. AdminNotificationMailer (`app/mailers/admin_notification_mailer.rb`)

Email notification system for admin alerts:

**Email Types:**
- **Data Conflict Notifications**: Sent when conflicts are detected during import
- **Job Failure Notifications**: Sent when the import job fails

**Email Features:**
- HTML and plain text versions for all emails
- Professional styling with color-coded conflict types
- Detailed conflict breakdowns with old/new value comparisons
- Summary statistics and actionable failure information
- Hardcoded recipient: `vosechu@gmail.com` (as requested)

### 3. Enhanced DownloadPropertyDataJob (`app/jobs/download_property_data_job.rb`)

The existing job has been enhanced with:

**New Capabilities:**
- Conflict detection during house import and ownership updates
- Automatic email notifications for conflicts and failures
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Graceful error handling with detailed failure notifications
- Performance tracking and summary reporting

**Process Flow:**
1. Initialize conflict manager
2. Fetch property data from PCPA GIS
3. Process each house with conflict detection
4. Send admin notifications if conflicts detected
5. Log comprehensive summary statistics
6. Handle failures with detailed error notifications

## Email Templates

### Data Conflict Notification
- **Subject**: "Data Conflicts Detected - {count} conflicts found"
- **Content**: Summary statistics, detailed conflict breakdowns, resolution actions
- **Styling**: Professional HTML with color-coded conflict types

### Job Failure Notification
- **Subject**: "Property Data Import Job Failed"
- **Content**: Error details, duration, immediate action items
- **Styling**: Alert-style formatting with clear action items

## Configuration Updates

### Development Environment (`config/environments/development.rb`)
- Enabled email delivery with SMTP configuration
- Configured for localhost testing (port 1025)
- Error reporting enabled for debugging

## Testing Infrastructure

### DataConflictManager Tests (`spec/services/data_conflict_manager_spec.rb`)
Comprehensive test coverage for:
- Address conflict detection
- Coordinate change detection (with distance calculations)
- Ownership conflict detection
- Summary generation and conflict categorization

### AdminNotificationMailer Tests (`spec/mailers/admin_notification_mailer_spec.rb`)
Email testing for:
- Proper recipient targeting
- Subject line generation
- Content inclusion verification
- Template rendering validation

## Conflict Resolution Strategy

**Current Implementation: "Latest Data Wins"**
- All conflicts are automatically resolved by accepting the newest data
- No manual intervention required
- All changes are logged for audit purposes

**Future Enhancement Opportunities:**
- Manual review workflow for critical conflicts
- Configurable resolution strategies
- Integration with admin dashboard for conflict review

## Audit and Logging

**Comprehensive Logging:**
- Individual conflict details logged as warnings
- Summary statistics logged as info
- All email delivery attempts logged
- Failure details captured with stack traces

**Log Format:**
- Structured JSON for summary data
- Human-readable conflict descriptions
- Timestamp and performance metrics
- Error context and stack traces

## Email Delivery Configuration

**Current Setup:**
- Development: SMTP on localhost:1025
- Admin email: vosechu@gmail.com (hardcoded as requested)
- Graceful fallback if email delivery fails

**Production Considerations:**
- Update SMTP settings in production environment
- Consider using email service (SendGrid, SES, etc.)
- Monitor email delivery success rates

## Usage and Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Trigger the job: `DownloadPropertyDataJob.perform_now`
2. Check logs for conflict detection
3. Verify email delivery (if SMTP configured)
4. Review conflict resolution in database

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run service tests
bundle exec rspec spec/services/data_conflict_manager_spec.rb

# Run mailer tests  
bundle exec rspec spec/mailers/admin_notification_mailer_spec.rb

# Run full test suite
bundle exec rspec
```

### Test Data Scenarios
- Import houses with changed addresses
- Update coordinates beyond threshold
- Change property ownership
- Simulate job failures

## Future Enhancements

1. **Manual Review Workflow**: Add admin dashboard for reviewing conflicts
2. **Configurable Thresholds**: Make distance and other thresholds configurable
3. **Conflict History**: Store conflict history in database
4. **Advanced Resolution**: Implement multiple resolution strategies
5. **Email Templates**: Add more sophisticated email templates
6. **Metrics Dashboard**: Add conflict trend analysis

## Implementation Notes

- All conflicts are currently auto-resolved with "latest data wins"
- Email delivery failures are gracefully handled and logged
- Audit trail maintained in application logs
- Performance optimized with efficient conflict detection
- Follows Rails conventions and project code style guide

## Files Modified/Created

**New Files:**
- `app/services/data_conflict_manager.rb`
- `app/mailers/admin_notification_mailer.rb`
- `app/views/admin_notification_mailer/data_conflict_notification.html.erb`
- `app/views/admin_notification_mailer/data_conflict_notification.text.erb`
- `app/views/admin_notification_mailer/job_failure_notification.html.erb`
- `app/views/admin_notification_mailer/job_failure_notification.text.erb`
- `spec/services/data_conflict_manager_spec.rb`
- `spec/mailers/admin_notification_mailer_spec.rb`

**Modified Files:**
- `app/jobs/download_property_data_job.rb`
- `config/environments/development.rb`

This implementation provides a robust foundation for data conflict management with comprehensive admin notifications while maintaining the simplicity and reliability of the existing import process.
