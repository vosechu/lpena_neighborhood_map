# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# For test data, use FactoryBot factories instead:
# - Regular user: create(:user)
# - Admin user: create(:admin_user)
# - House with residents: create(:house, :with_residents)
# - Resident: create(:resident)

# Example of creating test data in development:
# if Rails.env.development?
#   admin = create(:admin_user, email: 'admin@example.com', name: 'Admin User')
#   user = create(:user, email: 'user@example.com', name: 'Test User')
# end
