<h1>Welcome to the Neighborhood Directory!</h1>

<p>Hello <%= @user.name %>,</p>

<p>Someone in your neighborhood has added you to our local neighborhood directory and thought you might like to join our community online!</p>

<h2>What is this website?</h2>
<p>Our neighborhood directory is a simple way for neighbors to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Connect with each other</strong> - Find contact info and learn about your neighbors' skills</li>
  <li><strong>Share useful information</strong> - Let people know what you're good at or interested in</li>
  <li><strong>Build community</strong> - Strengthen connections in our neighborhood</li>
  <li><strong>Stay informed</strong> - See who lives where and how to reach them</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This is run by neighbors, for neighbors</strong> - not some big corporation. It's a grassroots effort to help our community stay connected.</p>
