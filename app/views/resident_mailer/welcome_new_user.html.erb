<h1>Hi neighbor!</h1>

<p>This is Chuck from the white house with the pergola at 6345 Burlington Ave N (the one with the wild pollinator garden in front). You might have seen me out gardening or walking our sweet old black lab Mia.</p>

<% if @inviter.present? %>
<p><strong>Your neighbor <%= @inviter.display_name %> at <%= @inviter.house.street_number %> <%= @inviter.house.street_name %> thought you might be interested in our neighborhood directory and asked me to send you an invite.</strong></p>
<% end %>

<p>I've been working on a neighborhood directory app specifically for our area, and I'd love to invite you to check it out. Think of it as a phone book, but just for people on our streets - a place where we can share contact info, remember the names of our neighbors, and stay connected as neighbors.</p>

<h2>Why am I reaching out?</h2>

<p>I know unsolicited emails feel sketchy, so here's what this actually is: I spent my own time building this because I wanted an easy way for our immediate neighbors to connect. No ads, no data selling, just a simple tool for our community.</p>

<h2>What I'm asking:</h2>

<p>I've created an account for you to make it easy to try out. The link below will let you set a password and take a look around:</p>

<p><%= link_to "Set Up Your Account", @login_url, style: "background-color: #4F46E5; color: white; padding: 12px 24px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 6px; display: inline-block;" %></p>

<p>I've added a basic entry for your address, but you control all your own information - edit what you want, keep private what you want, or delete it entirely if this isn't for you.</p>

<h2>A few reassurances:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Your address came from public property records, not any sketchy list</li>
  <li>Your email address came from <% if @inviter.present? %><em><%= @inviter.display_name %> at <%= @inviter.house.street_number %> <%= @inviter.house.street_name %></em><% else %><em>public records and neighborhood research</em><% end %></li>
  <li>This is a free community project, not a business</li>
  <li>You can contact me directly if you have concerns - my contact is below, but I'm also usually outside early morning on the weekends!</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to knock on my door if you'd rather talk in person, or just ignore this if it's not for you.</p>

<p>Thanks for being a great neighbor,<br>
